              <h2>Market Overview</h2>
              <p>
                The global defense cybersecurity market has experienced unprecedented growth, reaching $56.7 billion 
                in 2023 and projected to exceed $85 billion by 2030. This expansion reflects the critical importance 
                of cyber defense capabilities as military operations become increasingly digitized and interconnected. 
                Modern warfare extends beyond traditional kinetic domains to encompass sophisticated cyber operations 
                that can disable critical infrastructure, disrupt command and control systems, and compromise 
                sensitive intelligence assets.

                  <li>• Growing attack surface from IoT and connected systems</li>
                  <li>• Regulatory compliance requirements (CMMC, FedRAMP, etc.)</li>
                  <li>• Rising costs of successful cyber attacks</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <h2>Current Threat Landscape</h2>
              
              <h3>Nation-State Activities</h3>
              <p>
                Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) sponsored by nation-states represent the most significant 
                cybersecurity challenge facing defense organizations. These sophisticated actors possess substantial 
                resources, advanced capabilities, and strategic patience to conduct long-term campaigns against 
                military targets.
              </p>

              <p>
                Recent analysis indicates that state-sponsored groups have successfully compromised:
              </p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>Defense contractor networks containing sensitive design data</li>
                <li>Military communication systems and command networks</li>
                <li>Critical infrastructure supporting defense operations</li>
                <li>Supply chain components and software dependencies</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Quantum-Resistant Cryptography</h3>
              <p>
                The anticipated emergence of quantum computing capabilities poses an existential threat to current 
                cryptographic standards. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has begun 
                standardizing post-quantum cryptographic algorithms, creating new market demands for quantum-resistant 
                security solutions.
              </p>

              <h3>Cloud Security and Hybrid Environments</h3>
              <p>
                Military cloud adoption has accelerated dramatically, driven by initiatives like the Joint Enterprise 
                Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) and its successor, the Joint Warfighter Cloud Capability (JWCC). 
                This transition creates complex security challenges requiring specialized cloud security solutions.
