              <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <p>
                The Department of Defense procurement process represents one of the most complex and challenging 
                environments for technology companies seeking government contracts. With over $300 billion in 
                annual contracting opportunities, the potential rewards are substantial, but the barriers to entry 
                can seem insurmountable for companies unfamiliar with defense acquisition processes.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                This comprehensive guide outlines proven strategies for overcoming common acquisition barriers, 
                drawing from successful case studies and lessons learned from companies that have successfully 
                transitioned from commercial markets to defense contracting.
              </p>

              <h2>Understanding the Defense Acquisition Landscape</h2>

                Breaking down defense acquisition barriers requires patience, strategic planning, and sustained 
                commitment to understanding and adapting to the unique requirements of defense markets. While 
                the challenges are significant, the opportunities for companies that successfully navigate this 
                landscape are substantial.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Success depends on taking a methodical approach: starting with accessible entry points like 
                SBIR, building compliance capabilities incrementally, developing strong relationships across 
                the defense ecosystem, and consistently delivering exceptional performance. Companies that 
                invest in understanding the defense acquisition environment and commit to long-term engagement 
                will find significant opportunities for growth and impact in supporting national security objectives.
